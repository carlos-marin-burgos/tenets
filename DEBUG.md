## Debugging Figma Plugin Syntax Error

Since even the minimal version didn't work, this suggests a fundamental issue. Here are the debugging steps:

### Current Test Versions Available:

1. **Super Minimal** (135 bytes) - Currently active

   - Just logs and closes immediately
   - Should show nothing but console messages

2. **Ultra Minimal** (221 bytes)

   - Shows basic HTML dialog

3. **Minimal** (584 bytes)
   - Shows test button and handles interaction

### Potential Root Causes:

1. **File Loading Issue**: Figma can't read/parse the code.js file
2. **Manifest Issue**: Something wrong with manifest.json configuration
3. **Figma Environment**: Plugin development environment setup issue
4. **File Encoding**: Character encoding problems
5. **Figma Version**: Compatibility issue with Figma version

### Debugging Steps:

1. **Check Figma Developer Console**:

   - Open developer tools in Figma (Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
   - Look for more detailed error messages
   - Check if there are network errors loading the plugin

2. **Verify Plugin Files**:

   - Ensure `dist/code.js` and `manifest.json` are in the plugin folder
   - Check file permissions (should be readable)

3. **Test with Official Figma Plugin Template**:

   - Create a new plugin using Figma's official template
   - Compare the structure and build process

4. **Check Plugin Loading Method**:

   - Are you loading via "Development" > "Import plugin from manifest"?
   - Try refreshing/reloading the plugin

5. **Figma Version Check**:
   - Ensure you're using a recent version of Figma desktop app
   - Plugin development requires desktop app, not web version

### Next Steps:

1. Try the super minimal version (135 bytes) first
2. If it fails, the issue is in the fundamental setup
3. Check Figma developer console for more specific errors
4. Compare with a working Figma plugin template

### File Contents Summary:

- `manifest.json`: ✅ Valid format
- `dist/code.js`: ✅ 135 bytes, valid JavaScript syntax
- Build process: ✅ No compilation errors

The syntax error is likely happening during Figma's plugin loading process, not in our generated JavaScript.
